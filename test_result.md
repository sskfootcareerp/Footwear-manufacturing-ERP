# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITATION (not a bug): (10) Rate limit test failed — expected 429 after 5 failed login attempts, but got 401. Root cause: In Kubernetes load-balanced environment, requests are distributed across multiple backend pods (IPs 10.79.138.194 and 10.79.138.198 seen in logs), and the in-memory rate limiting (per-pod) doesn't accumulate properly. The rate limiting code is correct and unchanged (lines 103-108 in server.py), but doesn't work reliably in distributed environments. This is a known limitation of in-memory rate limiting in load-balanced setups, NOT a bug introduced by the auth fix. Recommendation: If rate limiting is critical for production, implement distributed rate limiting using Redis or similar shared state."

Empty column strings are converted to null before POST/PUT. Route added in App.js; nav link 'Listing Formats' under Core Operations (admin role only) in AppShell.jsx."

NOTE: Rate limiting works per-backend-pod (in-memory), so on load-balanced public URL it may take more attempts to trigger. On localhost (single instance) it works perfectly. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The most likely reason user sees 'invalid credentials' is (a) Rate limiting after multiple failed attempts - requires backend restart or 15-min wait to clear, (b) Copy-paste error with password (case-sensitive), or (c) Typing wrong password. Email case and whitespace are NOT issues (backend handles both). RECOMMENDATION: If user still reports issue, ask them to try: (1) Wait 15 minutes or ask admin to restart backend to clear rate limit, (2) Carefully re-type password 'admin123' (case-sensitive, no spaces), (3) Ensure no browser extensions interfering with login."

The one failed test (rate limiting) is an environmental limitation in Kubernetes load-balanced setup where in-memory rate limiting doesn't work reliably across multiple pods — NOT a bug in the auth fix.

          comment: "❌ BUG FOUND: POST /api/online-orders/import does NOT create picklists automatically even when stock is available in fg_location_inventory. Test scenario: Created style, added 10 pairs via production_in movement (verified in fg_location_inventory with qty=10, reserved_qty=0), created SKU map, imported online order for 5 pairs. Expected: fulfilled_from_stock=5, picklists_created=[1 picklist]. Actual: fulfilled_from_stock=0, picklists_created=[]. The online order import code at lines 5239-5276 in server.py queries fg_location_inventory to check available stock, but the query is not finding the records despite them existing in the database. Root cause: Unknown - the query logic looks correct (style_id ObjectId match, color/size match, qty > 0). Possible issues: (1) ObjectId conversion mismatch, (2) Color/size case sensitivity, (3) Missing reserved_qty field initialization in fg_location_inventory records, (4) Zone filtering issue. RECOMMENDATION: Debug the online order import code to identify why fg_location_inventory query is not returning results. Add logging to see what the query is finding. This is blocking the full WMS integration flow where online orders should automatically create picklists from ready stock."
